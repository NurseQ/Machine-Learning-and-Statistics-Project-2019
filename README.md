# Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project-2019


This repository contains a jupyter notebook, a standard license agreement, this readme and files to support the notebook. The jupyter notebook  concerns the [Boston House Prices](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) dataset and, using machine learning and analytics tools, analyze the dataset and predict house prices. This is in fulfillment of the requirements for the Machine Learning and Statistics class for the course Higher Diploma in Data Analytics. This course is offered by GMIT and taught by Dr. Ian McLoughlin. The notebook can be opened by clicking [here](https://github.com/NurseQ/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project-2019/blob/master/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project.ipynb).

The notebook is written in [python](https://www.python.org/) and uses several other packages and software to run or download the notebook. the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is recommended as the platform. The notebook also uses packages such [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [keras](https://keras.io/) among others. They are imported as they are used in the notebook. 

## Notebook content
The notebook first introduces the project and provides information about the dataset. An analysis of the Boston House Prices using desciptive statistics and plots follows the introduction. A section then follows where inferential statistics is used to analyse the difference in house prices within the dataset. Keras is then used to create a neural network to predict the median house prices based on the other variables in the dataset. Lastly, a section for references is at the end of the notebook. Comments are included within the code as needed and explanations regarding the outcome is provided.
